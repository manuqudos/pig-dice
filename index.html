          <li>Pig is game for 2 to 6 Players.</li>
          <li>Players take turns rolling a dice as many times as they like.</li>
          <li>If a roll is 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, the player adds that many points to their score for the turn.</li>
          <li>A player may choose to end their turn at any time and 'bank' their points.</li>
          <li>If a player rolls a 1, they lose all their unbanked points and their turn is over.</li>
          <li>The first player to score the target or more wins.</li>
